        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Rapid global industrial growth and population increase have led to critical challenges, including escalating energy shortages and severe environmental pollution. To achieve long-term sustainable development, the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies is imperative. Semiconductor-based photocatalysis, which directly harnesses abundant solar energy to drive chemical reactions, has emerged as a promising approach. This technology gained global recognition following the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972, who demonstrated water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen using a titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) electrode.
        </p>

        <h2>Main Concept</h2>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        <b>Main Concept: The Fundamental Mechanism:</b> Photocatalysis involves a precise physical process. When a semiconductor is exposed to light energy (photons) with energy equal to or exceeding its bandgap, an electron is excited from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band. This excitation generates an <b>electron-hole pair</b>. These charge carriers migrate to the catalyst surface to initiate redox reactions.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Photogenerated electrons in the conduction band possess strong reducing power, enabling the reduction of water ions (H<sup>+</sup>) into hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>).
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Positively charged holes in the valence band oxidize water to produce oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) or react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>.</sup>).
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Electrons also react with dissolved oxygen to form superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>). These Highly Reactive Oxygen Species mineralize toxic pollutants into harmless CO<sub>2</sub> and water.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂) remains the benchmark photocatalyst due to its stability, non-toxicity, and strong oxidizing power, but its wide bandgap restricts absorption mainly to ultraviolet light.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
        Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) is a metal-free semiconductor capable of visible-light absorption and improved hydrogen evolution performance.
        </p>


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
        Photocatalysis exemplifies the synergy between advanced materials science and solar energy. Continued nanoscale engineering of semiconductor heterojunctions will play a crucial role in sustainable water purification and solar-fuel production technologies.
