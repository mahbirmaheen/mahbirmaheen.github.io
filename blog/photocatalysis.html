            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rapid global industrial growth and population increase have led to critical challenges, including escalating energy shortages and severe environmental pollution. To achieve long-term sustainable development, the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies is imperative. Semiconductor-based photocatalysis, which directly harnesses abundant solar energy to drive chemical reactions, has emerged as a promising approach. This technology gained global recognition following the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda in 1972, who demonstrated water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen using a titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) electrode. Since then, photocatalysis has expanded into a significant research field and is now considered one of the most promising solutions for <b>artificial photosynthesis</b>, producing clean hydrogen fuel, and <b>environmental remediation, including wastewater and air purification.</b></p>
            <h2>Main Concept</h2>
            <p><b>Main Concept: The Fundamental Mechanism:</b> Photocatalysis involves a precise physical process. When a semiconductor is exposed to light energy (photons) with energy equal to or exceeding its bandgap, an electron is excited from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band. This excitation generates an <b>electron-hole pair.</b>These charge carriers migrate to the catalyst surface to initiate redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions.</p>
            <p><b>Photogenerated electrons</b> in the conduction band possess strong reducing power, enabling the reduction of water ions (H<sup>+</sup>) into hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>).</p>
