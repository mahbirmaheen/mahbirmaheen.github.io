            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            This poster highlights three historic disasters—the Tay Rail Bridge collapse, the Morandi Bridge failure, and the Bhopal Gas Tragedy—focusing on the critical material failures behind each. Understanding these events is key to improving material science, engineering design, and safety standards to prevent future tragedies.
            </p>

            <h2>Case 1: Tay Rail Bridge Disaster (1879)</h2>
            <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> On December 28, 1879, the Tay Rail Bridge in Scotland collapsed during a storm, sending a train and 75 people into the Firth of Tay.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Failure Aspect:</strong> Brittle Cast Iron, Low Fracture Toughness, Low Temperature Embrittlement.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Contributing Factors:</strong> Underestimation of Wind Loads, Design Flaws, Inadequate Testing & Standards, Lack of Maintenance & Inspection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case 2: The Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)</h2>
            <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> On December 2-3, 1984, a gas leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, released about 40 tons of toxic MIC gas, killing thousands and affecting hundreds of thousands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Failure Aspect:</strong> Corrosion of MIC Storage Tank, Runaway Chemical Reaction, Failure of Safety Systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Contributing Factors:</strong> Cost-Cutting Measures, Design and Siting Flaws, Lack of Maintenance & Inspection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case 3: Morandi Bridge Collapse (2018)</h2>
            <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> On August 14, 2018, Genoa's Morandi Bridge collapsed during heavy rain, killing 43 people due to critical structural weaknesses.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material Failure Aspect:</strong> Steel Corrosion, Concrete Degradation, Fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Contributing Factors:</strong> Harsh Environment, Design Limitations, Poor Maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Engineering Lessons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Principles Learned:</strong> Material Selection, Inspection Access, Fail-Safe Design.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Safety Improvements:</strong> Advanced Materials, Real-Time Monitoring, Predictive Maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            Three major disasters reveal the dangers of material failures like brittleness, corrosion, and equipment wear. Each led to improvements in engineering standards, material selection, and safety practices, stressing the need for proper analysis, smart materials, and regular maintenance.
